<p className='arttext4'>VoIP calls: What’s bandwidth got to do with it?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>VoIP calls: What’s<br/> bandwidth got to do<br/> with it?</p>

<p className='arttext5'>Since VoIP runs over the internet, it uses your broadband connection to make phone calls. Your internet connection speed is estimated as the<br/> amount of information that can be sent over a network in a certain amount of time.<br/><br/>

Bandwidth is the amount of data (information) that can be sent over your internet connection in a certain amount of time. This includes everything<br/> you do online, like clicking on links, downloading files, or using chat programs.
<br/><br/>
You must understand how VoIP works to understand the relationship between bandwidth and VoIP calling.<br/>
Voice over internet protocol (VoIP) systems uses compression to turn voice data into different codecs. The phone sends the codecs over the <br/>Internet to reach the other phone line.<br/><br/>

Based on the type of codec your system uses, you might need more bandwidth than the minimum required if you want to do something quickly and<br/> efficiently.<br/><br/>

So what are the VoIP internet speed requirements and data usage after all?</p>

<p className='arttext4'>What is the average bandwidth needed for VoIP?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>What is the average<br/> bandwidth needed <br/>for VoIP?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>Since we mentioned codecs, let's learn more about them first.<br/><br/>

Codecs are compression engines that encode incoming voice data into digital streams and then decode them at the end of the line. To understand<br/> the average or minimum bandwidth for VoIP, you'll need to consider the codec and number of phones.<br/><br/>

The new-gen G.729 codec consumes 32 kilobits per second (kbps). That's because the G.729 codec uses a compression algorithm. Still, the<br/> compression sacrifices sound or video quality for weight, so mobile data users prefer it.<br/><br/>

Mainly, business-oriented VoIP providers rely on The G.711 codec that uses a bandwidth of 87 kbps. Businesses prefer the G.711 codec because it<br/> does not use compression like other codecs, and the voice quality is much greater than that of regular phones.<br/><br/>

The bandwidth needed for VoIP data usage depends on how many phones are connected and the type of codec your service supports.<br/><br/>

For instance, if you are a small company with only 5 users who only sometimes use your phone lines, your bandwidth needs will be much different<br/> than a medium company with 20 users all using their phone lines regularly.

<p className='arttext4'>What is the recommended bandwidth for VoIP?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>What is the<br/> recommended<br/> bandwidth for VoIP?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>While there's no such thing as maximum bandwidth, since your codec will only consume the amount of bandwidth it's supposed to, there is an ideal<br/> bandwidth depending on your type of VoIP service.<br/><br/>

Usually, a compression codec uses less bandwidth, so a 3 to 5 Mbps connection is enough for most people. However, you may need a higher-speed<br/> connection if you want to download or upload large files.<br/><br/>

Since a G.711 codec uses more bandwidth, we recommend having 100 kbps available for every line connected. For example, 10 concurrent users<br/> would need = 10 x 100 kbps x safety margin, which means it's better to have 5 to 10 Mbps for upload and download.

<p className='arttext4'>Does VoIP phone slow down internet speed?
</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>Does VoIP phone slow <br/>down internet speed?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>People often need clarification about how VoIP works in business and how it can affect a company's overall performance. Understandably, "Does<br/> VoIP phone slow down the internet?" is a common question.<br/><br/>

But the answer is no; VoIP doesn't affect everyone's internet speed on the same connection. Most calls made on the internet are very small and<br/> won't have a big impact on your internet.<br/><br/>

In contrast, while your VoIP call doesn't affect internet speed, your internet speed is crucial in determining VoIP call quality. This is why there<br/> needs to be a minimum bandwidth and a secure connection to use VoIP services.<br/><br/>

The bottom line is that your VoIP phone calls won't hurt your internet speeds. Even in large offices or deployments of phones, it shouldn't make a <br/>difference.

<p className='arttext4'>VoIP Internet Speed Requirements for Businesses</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>VoIP Internet Speed<br/> Requirements for<br/> Businesses</p>
<p className='arttext5'>For a standard DSL, cable, or fiber connection, even the G.711 numbers are so small that you don't have to worry about speed and data usage.<br/><br/>

For VoIP calls made from the office, the amount of data used is a small issue if it's a large office or call center. Your staff can also use mobile VoIP <br/>to make business calls out of the office on their cell phones as long as they use cellular service with a large data cap/limit.<br/><br/>

A business plan for corporations usually offers unlimited data usage. Your VoIP will never use up your data cap regardless of the number of<br/> connections or codec type.<br/><br/>

If your employees work from home and have a residential broadband connection, we recommend checking their past usage and understanding the<br/> internet service provider's limits. If it doesn't meet the recommended VoIP bandwidth requirement, consider going for a greater data limit and <br/>internet quality.
