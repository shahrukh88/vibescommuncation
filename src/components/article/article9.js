<p className='arttext5'>Tracing VoIP numbers is fairly simple, though it can be time-consuming. Most providers will allow you a VoIP number lookup if you request it in<br/> writing. Simply provide the company with your account number and the phone number you would like to trace, and they should be able to route<br/> the request through their system.
<br/><br/>
If the number is associated with an active account, the provider may also be able to give you some basic information about the call, such as who<br/> was on the other end and when it occurred. However, tracing may not be possible if the number is not associated with an active account or if the<br/> provider does not have sufficient information for you to determine what happened.</p>

<p className='arttext6mba'>1. Set Up Caller ID on Your Device</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
Having caller ID enabled on your VoIP phone is a great way to reduce the time you spend trying to track down the owner of a VoIP call. Caller ID<br/> comes in two parts: Default VoIP phone number and Caller ID Name (CNAM). <br/><br/>

The Default VoIP phone number is the number that shows up on your VoIP dialing screen when someone calls you. You can usually find this <br/>information in your device's settings or online.
<br/><br/>
Calling party identification name, or CNAM is the second part of caller ID. This is the name that appears on your Caller ID screen when you make a<br/> VoIP call. Your carrier typically provides CNAM, and it's usually different from your default VoIP phone number.

If you are having trouble finding the owner of a phone number that was VoIP-called, use the Automated Service. This will provide the information <br/>to identify the caller, including their VoIP number and call time. You can also use this information to see if the caller has blocked or hidden their <br/>caller ID.

<p className='arttext6mba'>3. Reverse lookup VoIP</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
If you're trying to track down the owner of a VoIP call, a reverse phone search can be a helpful tool. Taking a caller ID and inputting it into an<br/> application or a lookup website can help you find the caller’s details, including their name and address.
<br/><br/>
When using these tools, be sure to enter the correct identifying information for the caller, such as their full name and phone number. Some sites <br/>also allow you to search by city or state, which can be helpful if you're tracking down a particular caller in a specific geographic territory. <br/>
Once you've found the information you need, it's usually easy to contact the person responsible for the VoIP call using that information. For<br/> example, if you know the caller's address, you can easily contact them via email or telephone.

<p className='arttext6mba'>4. Ask Your VoIP Service Provider</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
If you've ever had to track down the owner of a phone number that's been calling you, you know it can be a pain. Your VoIP service provider can <br/>help out.
<br/><br/>
First, ensure your caller ID is registered with your VoIP service provider. If it is, give your provider the call ID and time of the call. Your provider<br/> will likely have a record of who made the call and where it was made. <br/><br/>

If your VoIP service doesn't have caller ID tracking capabilities, or if the information you provide isn't enough to identify the caller, your provider<br/> may be able to trace the call using its IP address. All you need is the IP address and time of the call. Your provider can usually provide this<br/> information online or through support channels.

<p className='arttext6'>5. Install a Packet Analyzer to a Softphone or Hard phone</p>
<p className='arttext6mba'>5. Install a Packet Analyzer to a Softphone <br/>or Hard phone</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
If you're having difficulty understanding why a VoIP call is failing, or if you suspect that someone is cheating on a VoIP call, it might be time to <br/>install a packet analyzer. A packet analyzer captures and logs all the network traffic passing through it, which can help identify problems and<br/> track down who's responsible. <br/><br/>

Different packet analyzers are better suited for different tasks. A SIP hard phone is a desktop phone that looks like a traditional telephone. It’s<br/> connected to a Local Area Network (LAN), multiple devices grouped in a network to connect to internal servers and share a single internet<br/> connection. SIP softphones are calling apps and software that also use the call signaling protocol for VoIP to establish links to a telephone<br/> network.
<br/><br/>
A packet analyzer designed for use with SIP softphones will often have specific filters for capturing and displaying SIP traffic. This means you can<br/> see the IP addresses and Call Numbers and the identities of the VoIP owners involved in each call.

<p className='arttext6mba'>6. Perform an IP address search</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
If you're trying to track down the owner of a phone number that was dialed VoIP-style (over the Internet), your first step is to obtain the IP address<br/> of the caller. This can be done by asking the caller for their IP address or using an online lookup tool. <br/><br/>

Once you have the IP address, you can use an online WHOIS lookup tool to find out more about the IP owner - including their location, ISP, <br/> hostname, and contact information. This information can help you track the caller's location and identity, if necessary.

7. Directory Check for Fixed VoIP Number
</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
Try directory check if you're having trouble tracing a fixed VoIP number. Directory check includes searching for the number in public records, such <br/>as company filings, state databases, and the owner's or contact person's name. Many VoIP companies, like Vibes, list their numbers on specific<br/> websites or directories. <br/><br/>

You can also try reverse lookup services to see if there is any information available about the number owner that doesn't appear in public records. <br/> Reverse lookup services are often free and allow you to search for a name or phone number associated with a particular business or individual.

8. Check the VoIP call logs.

<p className='arttext5'>
If you are having difficulty finding a VoIP phone number owner, there is one way to do so. Check the VoIP call logs! This will provide you with a list<br/> of all the calls that were placed to and from the number and the time and date of each call. <br/><br/>

This method can be especially useful if you have misplaced or lost your original phone number. If you can match the time and date of a call in your<br/> log with when you think the phone was lost or stolen, you can track down its owner.

<p className='arttext6mba'>9. Talk to Law Enforcement</p>
<p className='arttext5'>You can talk to law enforcement if you're having trouble tracing a VoIP call's owner. Many law enforcement agencies have the resources and<br/> expertise to help with VoIP investigations. Some tips for talking to law enforcement about VoIP investigations include:
<br/><br/>
● Be prepared to provide as much information about the case as possible. This includes information about the call, the caller, and other relevant <br/>information.
<br/><br/>
● Make sure that your calls are traceable. This means ensuring that your phone numbers are sent directly to the appropriate authorities and not<br/> through third parties like servers or VoIP providers.
<br/><br/>
● Be honest and direct with law enforcement officials. Do not try to hide anything or play games to keep information from them.
