<p className='arttext4'>Are VoIP Calls Secure?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>Are VoIP Calls Secure?</p>

<p className='arttext5'>The short answer is that VoIP calls are as secure as any other phone call.<br/><br/>

VoIP calls are made over the internet, using your broadband connection instead of a phone line. That means anyone accessing your broadband <br/>network could eavesdrop on your VoIP calls.

<br/><br/>Most secure VoIP providers encrypt their service to prevent this from happening, but it’s important to check with your provider to ensure their<br/> encryption methods are up to scratch.

<br/><br/>There have been a few high-profile cases of hackers gaining access to people’s VoIP accounts and using them to make prank calls or even commit<br/> fraud. These incidents are usually the result of people using weak passwords or not securing their accounts properly.</p>

There are two primary DDoS attacks against VoIP systems: those that target the signaling protocol (SIP) and those that target the media transport<br/> protocol (RTP).

<p className='arttext4'>4. Vishing</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>4. Vishing</p>
<p className='arttext5'>Vishing is a VoIP hacking attack in which the attacker attempts to gain sensitive information by masquerading as a trusted entity. In a vishing<br/> attack, the attacker will often spoof the caller ID of a trusted phone number to trick the victim into answering the call.<br/><br/>

Once the victim answers the call, the attacker will try to collect personal information such as account numbers, passwords, or Social Security<br/> numbers. The attacker may also try to install malware on the victim's computer. Vishing attacks are difficult to detect because they rely on<br/> social engineering rather than technical exploits.</p>

<p className='arttext4'>5. Phreaking Attack</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>5. Phreaking Attack</p>
<p className='arttext5'>Phreaking involves exploiting the system. Hackers can make long-distance and international calls to your account without paying. They also add <br/>more credits to your phone account without permission and make any other call they want at your expense.
<br/><br/>
While this may not seem like much at first glance, it can quickly add up to large sums of money if the hacker can go undetected for a long period.<br/> In addition, they may also be able to access sensitive information such as customer credit card numbers or other personal data.</p>

<p className='arttext5'>Call tampering is when someone intercepts your VoIP calls, listens in on the conversation, or modifies the audio stream to insert their voice. Call<br/> tampering can be difficult to detect, but there are a few signs that you can look for, such as strange noises on the line or sudden changes in sound<br/> quality.</p>

<p className='arttext4mb'>8. Attacking VoIP Servers</p>
<p className='arttext5'>Attackers can also target VoIP servers to tamper with calls. By compromising a server, an attacker can add, remove, or modify entries in the<br/> server’s database, which controls which numbers are allowed to make calls through the system. This allows attackers to add themselves as<br/> “trusted” users who can make calls without being detected or blocking certain numbers from making calls altogether.</p>
