<p className='arttext4'>What is a Microsoft Teams Certification Program?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>What is a Microsoft <br/>Teams Certification<br/> Program?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>The Microsoft Teams Certification Program is designed to ensure that calls between people working together on the Teams platform are as smooth <br/>and enjoyable as possible. Only phones certified to work with Teams can be used in these calls.

1. A Microsoft Teams-supported desk phone.<br/>
2. A secure VoIP phone line connection and provider.<br/>
