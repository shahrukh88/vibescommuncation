<p className='arttext5'>Voice-over Internet Protocol is a way of sending voice data over the internet instead of through the traditional circuit transmissions that use the<br/> Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
<br/><br/>
This means that voice can be sent over the internet using analog signals, which are then turned into digital signals. It makes the voices much<br/> easier to understand and transmit over the internet, and you get a higher sound quality with less hassle and cost!</p>

<p className='arttext4mb'>When was VoIP <br/>Invented, and Who<br/> Created VoIP?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>VoIP is a technology that was created in the 1990s to help people save money on long-distance and international telephone charges. It began with<br/> a company called VocalTec, which created the first Internet phone.
<br/><br/>
Through this Internet phone, one user could call another through their computer and microphone, using the same software. In 1998, VocalTec<br/> came out with computer-to-telephone and phone-to-phone calling features for VoIP.
<br/><br/>
Telecommunication firms soon realized that IP (internet protocol) technology was a better way to transfer information than traditional telephone<br/> lines. The increased use of broadband internet service also helped promote VoIP adoption.</p>

<p className='arttext5'>A VoIP phone system should scale easily as your business grows. It should also have features like call forwarding and caller ID that can help you <br/>stay connected even when you're away from the office.<br/><br/>

Another important feature is auto-attendants, which can help route calls to the right person without you lifting a finger. Finally, ensure the system<br/> you choose has good customer support if you face any problems.

<p className='arttext4'>How VoIP Works Step by Step?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>How VoIP Works Step <br/>by Step?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
A VoIP system is a way to convert voice signals into digital signals so you can make phone calls over your broadband/wifi connection.<br/>
A typical VoIP configuration involves a desk phone and a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server. This allows you to use many more features than<br/> what you would get with a traditional landline phone.<br/><br/>

Since VoIP runs over the internet, your calls are stored securely in the cloud, and you can manage the VoIP system through an online dashboard.<br/>
The following steps explain the real-time process behind VoIP calling:<br/><br/>

Step 1: Converting voice signals into data packets<br/><br/>

Whether you're making a call through virtual or physical VoIP numbers, the application and adapter convert analog voice signals into compressed<br/> data packets of digital signals.<br/><br/>

Step 2: The Internet sends the data to the VoIP server<br/><br/>

Your broadband connection is a medium to send these data packets over to the VoIP server, where they get reconverted into digital sound signals.<br/><br/>
Step 3: Digital signals are received as sounds<br/><br/>

The VoIP server sends digital sound signals to the receiver's phone or connection and can be heard through their physical landlines or mobile <br/>phones.<br/><br/>

This process occurs almost instantaneously. The compressed data packets and wifi connection makes data transfer much faster than traditional <br/>phones with enhanced voice quality.</p>

<p className='arttext4'>Who Uses VoIP?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>Who Uses VoIP?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>VoIP systems are a popular choice for small businesses to large enterprises because they can improve efficiency and communication across a<br/> network of locations. In addition, using a single communications system for phones and data can save businesses money.
<br/><br/>
Multiple offices require many receptionists, expensive long-distance bills, and a complex administration process. VoIP systems give businesses a<br/> cost-effective solution with better quality and unbreakable connections.
<br/><br/>
The system also solves administrative problems with advanced features like call waiting, auto-attendant, call routing, multiple phone numbers,<br/> and a centralized dashboard to manage calls and caller data.</p>

<p className='arttext5'>Since VoIP runs on the internet, it's common to think it will go down with your internet.

<br/><br/>
This structure gives you the ultimate redundancy should something happen to one of the data centers. The VoIP provider would simply reroute all<br/> your calls to cell phones or other offices so that customers never know there is a problem.</p>
