<p className='arttext4'>What’s VoIP Termination in the First Place?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>What’s VoIP <br/>Termination in the<br/> First Place?</p>

<p className='arttext5'>Like voice termination for regular phone calls, VoIP termination is rerouting VoIP calls from the point of origin to an endpoint. The actual<br/> ‘termination’ happens when the call has been successfully routed to the recipient.<br/><br/>

Usually, service providers act as intermediaries to enable VoIP calls to be routed to a recipient anywhere in the world.</p>

<p className='arttext4mb'>What is A to Z VoIP Termination?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>‘A’ is the caller at point A who wants to place a call in a different country to the recipient ‘Z.’ As soon as the call is placed, one or more service<br/> providers help route the call so that ‘A’ can talk to ‘Z.’<br/><br/>

Everything from point A to Z, which consists of service providers routing the call, is the VoIP termination process. The actual termination happens<br/> when the VoIP call finally connects to ‘Z.’</p>

<p className='arttext4mb'>Some Common Questions</p>
<p className='arttext5'>In recent years, VoIP security has become an increasingly popular target for DDoS attacks. While the underlying technology of VoIP is quite robust,<br/> the fact that it relies on the public internet for connectivity makes it susceptible to attack.
<br/><br/>
There are two primary DDoS attacks against VoIP systems: those that target the signaling protocol (SIP) and those that target the media transport<br/> protocol (RTP).

<p className='arttext6'>Q. Are WhatsApp and Messenger Calls Technically VoIP Calls? If So, Do They Also Require A to Z VoIP Termination?</p>
<p className='arttext6mba'>Q. Are WhatsApp and Messenger Calls Technically VoIP Calls? If So, Do They Also Require A to Z VoIP Termination?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>A. No, VoIP calls are different from WhatsApp and Messenger calls. Such services require both the caller and recipient to have signed up on their<br/> platform.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, VoIP numbers act just like your regular phone number. You can place calls to any carrier worldwide using your VoIP number. This is<br/> enabled by A to Z t VoIP termination.</p>

<p className='arttext6'>Q. What’s Wholesale A to Z VoIP Termination? And Who Are Tier 1 and Tier VoIP Wholesalers?</p>
<p className='arttext6mba'>Q. What’s Wholesale A to Z VoIP Termination? And Who Are Tier 1 and Tier VoIP Wholesalers?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
A. Wholesale VoIP refers to a ‘tier 1 wholesaler’ who buys the rights to route calls between countries in bulk. This helps settle prices at pre-<br/>determined rates based on the average volume of calls. <br/><br/>

The Tier 1 wholesaler usually has other service providers as customers coming to buy a part of these calls. Smaller service providers who purchase<br/> only a portion of the overall calls from the Tier 1 wholesaler are referred to as Tier 2 wholesalers. These Tier 1 and Tier 2 wholesalers are the<br/> service providers responsible for enabling the rerouting of calls so that ‘A’ can connect with ‘Z.’

<p className='arttext6'>Q. What’s the Difference Between A to Z VoIP Origination and Termination?</p>
<p className='arttext6mba'>Q. What’s the Difference Between A to Z VoIP Origination and Termination?</p>
<p className='arttext5'>A. VoIP origination is the part where the call is initiated. Service providers look to route the call toward the endpoint in VoIP origination when the <br/>caller initiates the call. <br/><br/>

In contrast, VoIP termination refers to the recipient side of the process, where the goal is to finally connect the two parties. The overall VoIP call <br/>between the caller and the recipient is thus a two-part process.

Q. How are VoIP termination rates determined?
</p>
<p className='arttext6mba'>
Q. How are VoIP termination rates determined?
</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
A. VoIP termination rates depend on two primary factors. First, regulations for different countries directly influence termination rates. For<br/> example, Middle Eastern counties might intentionally set higher termination rates, while North American countries might have comparatively<br/> lower rates. Second, the average volume of incoming and outgoing calls impacts termination rates. <br/><br/>

Usually, if the volume of calls is higher, the termination rates are lower. But, some countries might intentionally set regulations to keep rates high.
