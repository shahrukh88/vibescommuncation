<p className='arttext4'>What exactly is a VoIP service?</p>
<p className='arttext4mb'>What exactly is a VoIP<br/> service?</p>

<p className='arttext5'>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a digital telephone system that allows users to make and receive phone calls over the internet instead of the<br/> traditional landline.<br/><br/>

You might know it as virtual telephony, a cloud-based phone system, IP telephony, or virtual calling software. Regardless of what you call it, it<br/> works the same way. VoIP services allow you to make voice calls over the Internet instead of using a landline phone.<br/><br/>

The current digital landscape has evolved well enough that landlines are no longer functional unless it's for business corporations. And even <br/>corporations are evolving their communication through VoIP services instead of traditional landlines. The reasons are simple:<br/><br/>

&#183; &nbsp;It's more affordable and scalable than landlines<br/>
&#183; &nbsp;There are more advanced features than standard business phone services<br/>
&#183; &nbsp;VoIP service is portable and flexible<br/>
&#183; &nbsp;You get to experience greater voice/call quality</p>

<p className='arttext6mb'>1. You need a special phone for VoIP</p>
<p className='arttext5'>
The first question that pops up is, usually, do I need a special phone for VoIP?<br/>
No, you don't. <br/>
VoIP can be used without any special devices or phones. While IP phones are often preferred, the key advantage of using VoIP is that you can use <br/>any phone device to operate your calls. You may have already invested significant money in your current PSTN telephones and can continue using<br/> them for VoIP if you have an ATA card.

<p className='arttext6mb'>2. It’s fairly easy to set up your own VoIP service</p>
<p className='arttext5mb'>Can you set up your own VoIP service? <br/>
It's more complex than that. While you can set up VoIP <br/>systems yourself, you should consult professionals to make it<br/> effective. Whether you have a lot of employees, a small<br/> team, or remote employees, it's always better to ask for <br/>professional help. <br/><br/>

If you need to implement VoIP on a large scale, you will <br/>likely need to employ more intricate steps than if you only <br/>need to handle a small subset of calls. Regardless of the<br/> scope of your setup, the equipment, connections, and <br/>software management is better done by experts to avoid <br/>downtime and technical issues in the future. <br/>
Even if you see a 5-step guide to set up your VoIP, think<br/> twice before implementing!

<p className='arttext6mb'>3. Emergency services can track VoIP</p>
<p className='arttext5'>Individuals and businesses value their privacy much more in today's time. So you might be wondering, can emergency service track VoIP? <br/>
Calls from traditional landlines give away information about an address, name, and callback number quite readily. However, VoIP services are<br/> designed to change that. You can rest assured that nobody (including emergency services) can track a VoIP caller. <br/><br/>
We suggest never using VoIP for emergency calls. Still, if you're using VoIP through a smart device, your chipset's GPS function will easily allow<br/> emergency services to track your call.

<p className='arttext5'>You don't need a standard phone service provider with VoIP. But does VoIP require a service provider at all?<br/>
Yes. <br/>
You need a VoIP service provider to manage calls from external sources. You can only make and receive internal calls within your organization's<br/> network if you don't have a SIP VoIP service provider. <br/>
You also need a VoIP host to unlock advanced VoIP capabilities. Cloud VoIP providers offer a wide range of features not available on traditional <br/>phone services.

<p className='arttext6mb'>5. VoIP services aren’t secure</p>
<p className='arttext5'>The most frequently asked question is, are VoIP phones secure? <br/><br/>

Every business needs to ensure its security to protect its data and assets. There is no difference between having a large organization and a small<br/> business. A disruption to your phone system could be quite catastrophic. <br/><br/>

The good news is that VoIP is quite secure. Reputable VoIP providers maintain military-grade security. The providers use Session Border<br/> Controllers (SBCs) for optimal security and performance. An SBC acts as a firewall that helps to maintain performance and logical call routing.<br/> Rest assured, you can sleep soundly at night knowing your VoIP calls are secure!

Users of smartphones and cell phones can use VoIP services to communicate with others. The VoIP phone service provider helps you install the <br/>app to support the system. Some providers give you a SIM card, an app, and an unlocked handset. You can usually just use your current data plan<br/> without worrying about unlocking it.

You have used a phone number for years, and many people recognize you or your company through it. You wish to switch to VoIP but don't want to<br/> go with a new number either. Switching to VoIP means choosing a new phone service provider, but can you continue using your existing landline<br/> phone number with your new VoIP service? <br/><br/>

The misconception that you can't link your old number to a VoIP service seems unreasonable because providers understand why you would want to<br/> keep it. <br/>
So yes, you can bring your existing phone

<p className='arttext6mb'>8. All phones are VoIP compatible</p>
<p className='arttext5'>

This isn't exactly a misconception but more of a misunderstanding. VoIP can work on any device, including IP phones, smartphones, cellphones,<br/> softphones, tablets, and IP handsets. However, VoIP service isn't compatible with traditional landlines. <br/><br/>

So the answer to the question “Are all phones VoIP compatible?” is a clear no. <br/>
But, if you’re wondering if you can use a normal phone with VoIP, then the answer is yes. <br/><br/>

This means that while traditional landlines aren't compatible with VoIP, you can still use them for VoIP services. You'll only need to connect a<br/> special Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) to make a standard telephone work for VoIP.

9. VoIP phones work without the internet

<p className='arttext5'>No, they don't.<br/>
VoIP is not possible without an internet connection. VoIP phone calls are made over the internet rather than over phone lines. If the internet<br/> connection is lost or goes down, you won't be able to make phone calls. <br/><br/>

VoIP ultimately depends on your internet connection. So if you're facing internet downtime, you'll also face VoIP downtime. This is why you need to<br/> test your internet speed and connection reliability before switching to VoIP.

Business VoIP also offers a higher level of security, more advanced features, and room for customization to meet your business's needs.<br/> Fundamentally, both are different applications of VoIP, but they work differently based on user criteria.

However, the reliability of your VoIP service will depend on your internet service provider. The SIP protocol provides error-correction capabilities,<br/> such as TCP or UDP.
